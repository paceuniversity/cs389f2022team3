### **Target SDG(s):** 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation

#

**1. What is/are the problem/s you want to solve? Why is it important?**
    
    Do you know what is in your water when you drink it? People would believe that the information would be accessible and reliable, but it is not. We are looking for a way to give access to the information people deserve about the safety of their drinking water. This will play part in preventing incidents where an unsafe drinking water supply is consumed and the buildup of toxins causes harm, because there was no detection the unsafe drinking water caused harmful effects.

**2. Who are the users you are targeting?**

    Our target audience will be focused mainly on those who fall within the struggling socio-economic demographic. The reason for this is because the latter group is typically the victim of contaminants being introduced to their drinking supply. Since this is project is limited by our ability to scale, we are going to be focusing on Pace as our hyper-local water supply data source.

**3. How will this app solve the tackled problem/s? Provide a vision statement.**

    We seek to provide the people their right to know what is in their drinking water in a reliable and timely manner. Specifically, Pace has its own community water supply compared to other universities that share them with their neighboring towns. We are providing a way for students to be aware of their water.

**4. What are the major features of the app?**

    Push Notification Alerts (Main Feature) – Ability to receive scheduled reports based on user preference through push notification. Emergency alert for unsafe water quality indexes in the user’s geofenced location. Emergency alerts are not automatically sent and require administrative action to prevent accidental push notifications causing panic.

    Water Quality Dashboard – Detailed reports of water quality index and other general-purpose feeds or news reports.


**5. What similar apps exist on the market? (at least 5 apps with names, screenshots, links, descriptions and how different they are from what you want to do)**

    There are no apps that show any similarities to what we envision to create.

**6. How is your app unique?**

    There are none that exist yet so it will be a proof of concept for us.

**7. What are the risks associated with the development of this app? Why wouldn’t it be delivered completely (scope), on time and on budget? Identify 3 to 5 risks that are relevant in your case.**

    Of the many risks that could possibly affect the progression of our app development the main ones that standout to us would be infrastructure cost, scalability, and analysis of data. Our app is dependent on the data we collect to present it in an understandable message. The large amounts of data will require real time analysis to determine what the quality index is. 
    
    We are looking to expand to multiple regions raising issues with scaling to allow the flow of large amounts of data. Both concerns delve into the most important which is cost. To get the bare minimum up and running we would require multiple SaaS instances, a no-SQL timeseries database, API Gateways, Push Notification services, and once we reach critical mass that is all raised a magnitude to include things such as high availability and load balancers.

**8. What is your goal with this project? (build portfolio/resume, get experience in mobile app dev …)**

    To build skills that apply to a real-world software engineering environment such as utilizing version control software, time/cost management, and the idea of scrum.
